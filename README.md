# Risk Factors Simulation assuming Geometric Brownian Motion

Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is commonly used in finance to model stock prices and their future behaviour. It is a stochastic process where the logarithm of the randomly varying variable follows a Brownian motion with drift.

US market stocks of top 5 companies (according to Fortune 500) have been chosen for this project.
Assuming GBM:
- Covariance Matric and Correlation Matrix have been created; commonly used in portfolio optimization.
- Mode Carlo Simulations have been generated to calculate the projected stock price averages and the expected returns on 1 year horizon.
